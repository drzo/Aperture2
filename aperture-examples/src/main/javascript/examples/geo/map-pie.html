	<p>In this example, a radial indicator layer is overlaid on the map displaying notional
	opinion poll data for four cities.  When the mouse is over a segment of one of the indicators,
	the corresponding response is displayed in text form above and all wedges of that type highlight.
	This example makes use of mouse hover event listeners and visual mapping filters to
	apply alternate styles to hovered data.</p>
	
	<div id="map" style="left: 0px; right: 0px; height:400px;"></div>

	<p><b><span id="hover"></span>&nbsp;</b></p>
