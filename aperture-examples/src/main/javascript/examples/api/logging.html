	<p>This example demonstrates the use of the logging system and a variety of
	logging appenders.  When the "Log" button is pressed, an error, a warning,
	and an info message are logged.  A console appender logs these messages to your
	browser console, a DOM appender logs the messages (WARN and higher) to a DIV
	element above, and a buffering appender collects all logged messages in an
	array that can be accessed at a later time.  The number of messages that are
	currently in the buffer is displayed below the log button.  Clicking "Clear"
	only clears the DOM appender's output window. To demonstrate logging of objects 
	on older browsers this example includes a copy of json2.js, Douglas Crockford's
	simple polyfill for ECMAScript 5 JSON formatting.</p>
